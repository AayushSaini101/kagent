      "\n",
      "1. **Check Connection Security Policy:**\n",
      "   You can query the Prometheus metrics to determine if mTLS is enabled by checking the `connection_security_policy` label. Look for the metric `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total` or similar metrics that include the `connection_security_policy` label.\n",
