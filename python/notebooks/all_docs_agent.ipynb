In particular, the `Subject Alternative Name` field should be `URI:spiffe://cluster.local/ns/my-ns/sa/my-sa`.\\\\n\\\\nMutual TLS errors\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you suspect problems with mutual TLS, first ensure that istiod is healthy, and second ensure that keys and certificates are being delivered to sidecars properly.\\\\n\\\\nIf everything appears to be working so far, the next step is to verify that the right [authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) is applied and the right destination rules are in place.\\\\n\\\\nIf you suspect the client side sidecar may send mutual TLS or plaintext traffic incorrectly, check the [Grafana Workload dashboard](/latest/docs/ops/integrations/grafana/). The outbound requests are annotated whether mTLS is used or not. After checking this if you believe the client sidecars are misbehaved, report an issue on GitHub.\\\\n\\\\nSee\\'}, {\\'distance\\': 0.9569849371910095, \\'content\\': \\'\\\\nDemonstrates the collection and querying of metrics within Istio.\\\\n\\\\n\\'}, {\\'distance\\': 0.9580562710762024, \\'content\\': \\'\\\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\\\n\\\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\\\n\\\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\ncontainers:\\\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\\\n    ...\\\\n    volumeMounts:\\\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\\\n      name: istio-certs\\\\nvolumes:\\\\n  - emptyDir:\\\\n      medium: Memory\\\\n    name: istio-certs\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nspec:\\\\n  template:\\\\n    metadata:\\\\n      annotations:\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\\\n          proxyMetadata:\\\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\\\\\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\\\\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nscheme: https\\\\ntls_config:\\\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBest practices\\\\n--------------\\\\n\\\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

The outbound requests are annotated whether mTLS is used or not. After checking this if you believe the client sidecars are misbehaved, report an issue on GitHub.\\n\\nSee'}, {'distance': 0.9569849371910095, 'content': '\\nDemonstrates the collection and querying of metrics within Istio.\\n\\n'}, {'distance': 0.9580562710762024, 'content': '\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\n\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\n\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\n\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\n\\n```yaml\\ncontainers:\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\n    ...\\n    volumeMounts:\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\n      name: istio-certs\\nvolumes:\\n  - emptyDir:\\n      medium: Memory\\n    name: istio-certs\\n```\\n\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\n\\n```yaml\\nspec:\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      annotations:\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\n          proxyMetadata:\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\n```\\n\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nscheme: https\\ntls_config:\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\n```\\n\\nBest practices\\n--------------\\n\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

In particular, the `Subject Alternative Name` field should be `URI:spiffe://cluster.local/ns/my-ns/sa/my-sa`.\\\\n\\\\nMutual TLS errors\\\\n-----------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you suspect problems with mutual TLS, first ensure that istiod is healthy, and second ensure that keys and certificates are being delivered to sidecars properly.\\\\n\\\\nIf everything appears to be working so far, the next step is to verify that the right [authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) is applied and the right destination rules are in place.\\\\n\\\\nIf you suspect the client side sidecar may send mutual TLS or plaintext traffic incorrectly, check the [Grafana Workload dashboard](/latest/docs/ops/integrations/grafana/). The outbound requests are annotated whether mTLS is used or not. After checking this if you believe the client sidecars are misbehaved, report an issue on GitHub.\\\\n\\\\nSee\\'}, {\\'distance\\': 0.9735915660858154, \\'content\\': \\'\\\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\\\n\\\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\\\n\\\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\ncontainers:\\\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\\\n    ...\\\\n    volumeMounts:\\\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\\\n      name: istio-certs\\\\nvolumes:\\\\n  - emptyDir:\\\\n      medium: Memory\\\\n    name: istio-certs\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nspec:\\\\n  template:\\\\n    metadata:\\\\n      annotations:\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\\\n          proxyMetadata:\\\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\\\\\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\\\\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nscheme: https\\\\ntls_config:\\\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBest practices\\\\n--------------\\\\n\\\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

The outbound requests are annotated whether mTLS is used or not. After checking this if you believe the client sidecars are misbehaved, report an issue on GitHub.\\n\\nSee'}, {'distance': 0.9735915660858154, 'content': '\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\n\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\n\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\n\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\n\\n```yaml\\ncontainers:\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\n    ...\\n    volumeMounts:\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\n      name: istio-certs\\nvolumes:\\n  - emptyDir:\\n      medium: Memory\\n    name: istio-certs\\n```\\n\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\n\\n```yaml\\nspec:\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      annotations:\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\n          proxyMetadata:\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\n```\\n\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nscheme: https\\ntls_config:\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\n```\\n\\nBest practices\\n--------------\\n\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Metric**: `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total` is used here to represent the count of TCP connections initiated in your service mesh.\n",
      "- **Label**: `connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\"` ensures that you are assessing connections specifically protected by mutual TLS.\n",
      "\n",
      "By utilizing this setup, you can confirm the proper enforcement of mTLS within your Istio configuration, ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication paths between your services. This protects data integrity and confidentiality across service interactions.\n",
