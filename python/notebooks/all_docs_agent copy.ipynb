[Validate with `tcpdump`](#validate-with-tcpdump)\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have added applications to an ambient mesh, you can easily validate mTLS is enabled among your workloads using one or more of the methods below:\\\\n\\\\nValidate mTLS using workload’s ztunnel configurations\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nUsing the convenient `istioctl ztunnel-config workloads` command, you can view if your workload is configured to send and accept HBONE traffic via the value for the `PROTOCOL` column. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n$ istioctl ztunnel-config workloads\\\\nNAMESPACE    POD NAME                                IP         NODE                     WAYPOINT PROTOCOL\\\\ndefault      details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx              10.42.0.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      kubernetes                              172.20.0.3                          None     TCP\\\\ndefault      productpage-v1-c5b7f7dbc-hlhpd          10.42.0.8  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      ratings-v1-68d5f5486b-b5sbj             10.42.0.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v1-7dc5fc4b46-ndrq9             10.42.1.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v2-6cf45d556b-4k4md             10.42.0.7  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v3-86cb7d97f8-zxzl4             10.42.1.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHaving HBONE configured on your workload doesn’t mean your workload will reject any plaintext traffic. If you want your workload to reject plaintext traffic, create a `PeerAuthentication` policy with mTLS mode set to `STRICT` for your workload.\\\\n\\\\nValidate mTLS from metrics\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have installed Prometheus, you can set up port-forwarding and open the Prometheus UI by using the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n$ istioctl dashboard prometheus\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn Prometheus, you can view the values for the TCP metrics. First, select Graph and enter the a metric such as: `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total`, `istio_tcp_connections_closed_total`, `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total`, or `istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total`. Lastly, click Execute. The data will contain entries such as:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nistio_tcp_connections_opened_total{\\\\n  app=\"ztunnel\",\\\\n  connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\",\\\\n  destination_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\",\\\\n  destination_service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\",\\\\n  reporter=\"source\",\\\\n  request_protocol=\"tcp\",\\\\n  response_flags=\"-\",\\\\n  source_app=\"curl\",\\\\n  source_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\",source_workload_namespace=\"default\",\\\\n  ...}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nValidate that the `connection_security_policy` value is set to `mutual_tls` along with the expected source and destination identity information.\\\\n\\\\nValidate mTLS from logs\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nYou can also view either the source or destination ztunnel log to confirm mTLS is enabled, along with peer identities. Below is an example of the source ztunnel’s log for a request from the `curl` service to the `details` service:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n2024-08-21T15:32:05.754291Z info access connection complete src.addr=10.42.0.9:33772 src.workload=\"curl-7656cf8794-6lsm4\" src.namespace=\"default\"\\\\nsrc.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\" dst.addr=10.42.0.5:15008 dst.hbone_addr=10.42.0.5:9080 dst.service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\"\\\\ndst.workload=\"details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx\" dst.namespace=\"default\" dst.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\"\\\\ndirection=\"outbound\" bytes_sent=84 bytes_recv=358 duration=\"15ms\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nValidate the `src.identity` and `dst.identity` values are correct. They are the identities used for the mTLS communication among the source and destination workloads. Refer to the verifying ztunnel traffic through logs section for more details.\\\\n\\\\nValidate with Kiali dashboard\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have Kiali and Prometheus installed, you can visualize your workload communication in the ambient mesh using Kiali’s dashboard. You can see if the connection between any workloads has the padlock icon to validate that mTLS is enabled, along with the peer identity information:\\\\n\\\\n[](/latest/docs/ambient/usage/verify-mtls-enabled/kiali-mtls.png)\\\\n\\\\nKiali dashboard\\\\n\\\\nRefer to the Visualize the application and metrics document for more details.\\\\n\\\\nValidate with `tcpdump`\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have access to your Kubernetes worker nodes, you can run the `tcpdump` command to capture all traffic on the network interface, with optional focusing the application ports and HBONE port. In this example, port `9080` \\'}, {\\'distance\\': 0.9523152112960815, \\'content\\': \\'\\\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\\\n\\\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\\\n\\\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\\\n\\\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\ncontainers:\\\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\\\n    ...\\\\n    volumeMounts:\\\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\\\n      name: istio-certs\\\\nvolumes:\\\\n  - emptyDir:\\\\n      medium: Memory\\\\n    name: istio-certs\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nspec:\\\\n  template:\\\\n    metadata:\\\\n      annotations:\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\\\n          proxyMetadata:\\\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\\\\\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\\\\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nscheme: https\\\\ntls_config:\\\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nBest practices\\\\n--------------\\\\n\\\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

For example:\\n\\n```yaml\\n$ istioctl ztunnel-config workloads\\nNAMESPACE    POD NAME                                IP         NODE                     WAYPOINT PROTOCOL\\ndefault      details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx              10.42.0.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      kubernetes                              172.20.0.3                          None     TCP\\ndefault      productpage-v1-c5b7f7dbc-hlhpd          10.42.0.8  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      ratings-v1-68d5f5486b-b5sbj             10.42.0.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v1-7dc5fc4b46-ndrq9             10.42.1.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v2-6cf45d556b-4k4md             10.42.0.7  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v3-86cb7d97f8-zxzl4             10.42.1.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\n```\\n\\nHaving HBONE configured on your workload doesn’t mean your workload will reject any plaintext traffic. If you want your workload to reject plaintext traffic, create a `PeerAuthentication` policy with mTLS mode set to `STRICT` for your workload.\\n\\nValidate mTLS from metrics\\n--------------------------\\n\\nIf you have installed Prometheus, you can set up port-forwarding and open the Prometheus UI by using the following command:\\n\\n```yaml\\n$ istioctl dashboard prometheus\\n```\\n\\nIn Prometheus, you can view the values for the TCP metrics. First, select Graph and enter the a metric such as: `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total`, `istio_tcp_connections_closed_total`, `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total`, or `istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total`. Lastly, click Execute. The data will contain entries such as:\\n\\n```yaml\\nistio_tcp_connections_opened_total{\\n  app=\"ztunnel\",\\n  connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\",\\n  destination_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\",\\n  destination_service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\",\\n  reporter=\"source\",\\n  request_protocol=\"tcp\",\\n  response_flags=\"-\",\\n  source_app=\"curl\",\\n  source_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\",source_workload_namespace=\"default\",\\n  ...}\\n```\\n\\nValidate that the `connection_security_policy` value is set to `mutual_tls` along with the expected source and destination identity information.\\n\\nValidate mTLS from logs\\n-----------------------\\n\\nYou can also view either the source or destination ztunnel log to confirm mTLS is enabled, along with peer identities. Below is an example of the source ztunnel’s log for a request from the `curl` service to the `details` service:\\n\\n```yaml\\n2024-08-21T15:32:05.754291Z info access connection complete src.addr=10.42.0.9:33772 src.workload=\"curl-7656cf8794-6lsm4\" src.namespace=\"default\"\\nsrc.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\" dst.addr=10.42.0.5:15008 dst.hbone_addr=10.42.0.5:9080 dst.service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\"\\ndst.workload=\"details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx\" dst.namespace=\"default\" dst.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\"\\ndirection=\"outbound\" bytes_sent=84 bytes_recv=358 duration=\"15ms\"\\n```\\n\\nValidate the `src.identity` and `dst.identity` values are correct. They are the identities used for the mTLS communication among the source and destination workloads. Refer to the verifying ztunnel traffic through logs section for more details.\\n\\nValidate with Kiali dashboard\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIf you have Kiali and Prometheus installed, you can visualize your workload communication in the ambient mesh using Kiali’s dashboard. You can see if the connection between any workloads has the padlock icon to validate that mTLS is enabled, along with the peer identity information:\\n\\n[](/latest/docs/ambient/usage/verify-mtls-enabled/kiali-mtls.png)\\n\\nKiali dashboard\\n\\nRefer to the Visualize the application and metrics document for more details.\\n\\nValidate with `tcpdump`\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIf you have access to your Kubernetes worker nodes, you can run the `tcpdump` command to capture all traffic on the network interface, with optional focusing the application ports and HBONE port. In this example, port `9080` '}, {'distance': 0.9523152112960815, 'content': '\\nThe control plane, gateway, and Envoy sidecar metrics will all be scraped over cleartext. However, the application metrics will follow whatever [Istio authentication policy](/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/) has been configured for the workload.\\n\\n*   If you use `STRICT` mode, then Prometheus will need to be configured to scrape using Istio certificates as described below.\\n*   If you use `PERMISSIVE` mode, the workload typically accepts TLS and cleartext. However, Prometheus cannot send the special variant of TLS Istio requires for `PERMISSIVE` mode. As a result, you must _not_ configure TLS in Prometheus.\\n*   If you use `DISABLE` mode, no TLS configuration is required for Prometheus.\\n\\nOne way to provision Istio certificates for Prometheus is by injecting a sidecar which will rotate SDS certificates and output them to a volume that can be shared with Prometheus. However, the sidecar should not intercept requests for Prometheus because Prometheus’s model of direct endpoint access is incompatible with Istio’s sidecar proxy model.\\n\\nTo achieve this, configure a cert volume mount on the Prometheus server container:\\n\\n```yaml\\ncontainers:\\n  - name: prometheus-server\\n    ...\\n    volumeMounts:\\n      mountPath: /etc/prom-certs/\\n      name: istio-certs\\nvolumes:\\n  - emptyDir:\\n      medium: Memory\\n    name: istio-certs\\n```\\n\\nThen add the following annotations to the Prometheus deployment pod template, and deploy it with [sidecar injection](/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). This configures the sidecar to write a certificate to the shared volume, but without configuring traffic redirection:\\n\\n```yaml\\nspec:\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      annotations:\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeInboundPorts: \"\"   # do not intercept any inbound ports\\n        traffic.sidecar.istio.io/includeOutboundIPRanges: \"\"  # do not intercept any outbound traffic\\n        proxy.istio.io/config: |  # configure an env variable `OUTPUT_CERTS` to write certificates to the given folder\\n          proxyMetadata:\\n            OUTPUT_CERTS: /etc/istio-output-certs\\n        sidecar.istio.io/userVolumeMount: \\'[{\"name\": \"istio-certs\", \"mountPath\": \"/etc/istio-output-certs\"}]\\' # mount the shared volume at sidecar proxy\\n```\\n\\nFinally, set the scraping job TLS context as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nscheme: https\\ntls_config:\\n  ca_file: /etc/prom-certs/root-cert.pem\\n  cert_file: /etc/prom-certs/cert-chain.pem\\n  key_file: /etc/prom-certs/key.pem\\n  insecure_skip_verify: true  # Prometheus does not support Istio security naming, thus skip verifying target pod certificate\\n```\\n\\nBest practices\\n--------------\\n\\nFor larger meshes, advanced configuration might help Prometheus scale.

      "To check if Istio requests are using mTLS, you can use Prometheus metrics to verify the connection security policy. Here's how you can set up the Prometheus query:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access the Prometheus Dashboard**: Ensure that Prometheus is installed and running. You can start the Prometheus UI using Istio's built-in command:\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   istioctl dashboard prometheus\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Query for mTLS Connections**: In the Prometheus UI, you can run the following query to check if connections are using mutual TLS:\n",
      "   ```plaintext\n",
      "   istio_tcp_connections_opened_total{connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\"}\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "This query lets you see the total TCP connections where the `connection_security_policy` label is set to `mutual_tls`. This metric confirms that mTLS is being used for those connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Review the Metrics Output**: Analyze the output to determine the usage of mTLS. If you see metrics with `connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\"`, then requests are using mutual TLS.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach utilizes Istio's integrated metrics within Prometheus to determine the security policies applied across your service mesh. For further details, you can explore Istio’s official documentation on [authentication policies](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/authn-policy/).\n",
