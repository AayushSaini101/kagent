The PEPs are implemented using Envoy. The following diagram shows the architecture.</p> Security Architecture<p>In the following sections, we introduce the Istio security features in detail.</p><h2>Istio identity<a href=\\\\\"#istio-identity\\\\\"></a></h2><p>Identity is a fundamental concept of any security infrastructure. At the beginning of a workload-to-workload communication, the two parties must exchange credentials with their identity information for mutual authentication purposes. On the client side, the server\\\\u2019s identity is checked against the <a href=\\\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming\\\\\">secure naming</a> information to see if it is an authorized runner of the workload. On the server side, the server can determine what information the client can access based on the <a href=\\\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization-policies\\\\\">authorization policies</a>, audit who accessed what at what time, charge clients based on the workloads they used, and reject any clients who failed to pay their bill from accessing the workloads.</p><p>The Istio identity model uses the first-class <code>service identity</code> to determine the identity of a request\\\\u2019s origin. This model allows for great flexibility and granularity for service identities to represent a human user, an individual workload, or a group of workloads. On platforms without a service identity, Istio can use other identities that can group workload instances, such as service names.</p><p>The following list shows examples of service identities that you can use on different platforms:</p><ul><li>Kubernetes: Kubernetes service account</li><li>GCE: GCP service account</li><li>On-premises (non-Kubernetes): user account, custom service account, service name, Istio service account, or GCP service account. The custom service account refers to the existing service account just like the identities that the customer\\\\u2019s Identity Directory manages.</li></ul><h2>Identity and certificate management<a href=\\\\\"#pki\\\\\"></a></h2><p>Istio securely provisions strong identities to every workload with X.509 certificates. Istio agents, running alongside each Envoy proxy, work together with <code>istiod</code> to automate key and certificate rotation at scale. The following diagram shows the identity provisioning flow.</p> Identity Provisioning Workflow<p>Istio provisions keys and certificates through the following flow:</p><ol><li><code>istiod</code> offers a gRPC service to take <a href=\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request\\\\\">certificate signing requests</a>6 (CSRs).</li><li>When started, the Istio agent creates the private key and CSR, and then sends the CSR with its credentials to <code>istiod</code> for signing.</li><li>The CA in <code>istiod</code> validates the credentials carried in the CSR. Upon successful validation, it signs the CSR to generate the certificate.</li><li>When a workload is started, Envoy requests the certificate and key from the Istio agent in the same container via the <a href=\\\\\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/security/secret#secret-discovery-service-sds\\\\\">Envoy secret discovery service (SDS)</a>7 API.</li><li>The Istio agent sends the certificates received from <code>istiod</code> and the private key to Envoy via the Envoy SDS API.</li><li>Istio agent monitors the expiration of the workload certificate. The above process repeats periodically for certificate and key rotation.</li></ol><h2>Authentication<a href=\\\\\"#authentication\\\\\"></a></h2><p>Istio provides two types of authentication:</p><ul><li><p>Peer authentication: used for service-to-service authentication to verify the client making the connection. Istio offers <a href=\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication\\\\\">mutual TLS</a>8 as a full stack solution for transport authentication, which can be enabled without requiring service code changes. This solution:</p><ul><li>Provides each service with a strong identity representing its role to enable interoperability across clusters and clouds.</li><li>Secures service-to-service communication.</li><li>Provides a key management system to automate key and certificate generation, distribution, and rotation.</li></ul></li><li><p>Request authentication: Used for end-user authentication to verify the credential attached to the request. Istio enables request-level authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT) validation and a streamlined developer experience using a custom authentication provider or any OpenID Connect providers, for example:</p></li></ul><p>In all cases, Istio stores the authentication policies in the <code>Istio config store</code> via a custom Kubernetes API. <span class=\\\\\"term\\\\\">Istiod</span> keeps them up-to-date for each proxy, along with the keys where appropriate. Additionally, Istio supports authentication in permissive mode to help you understand how a policy change can affect your security posture before it is enforced.</p><div class=\\\\\"popover\\\\\"><p><i></i><span> Istiod</span></p><div class=\\\\\"body\\\\\"><p>The Istiod component is the consolidated control plane binary that encapsulates the functions of Pilot, Galley, Citadel, and the sidecar injector.</p> <p><a href=\\\\\"/blog/2020/istiod/\\\\\">Learn more about Istiod</a>.</p> </div><p></p></div><h3>Mutual TLS authentication<a href=\\\\\"#mutual-tls-authentication\\\\\"></a></h3><p>Istio tunnels service-to-service communication through the client- and <p>server-side PEPs, which are implemented as <a href=\\\\\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/\\\\\">Envoy proxies</a>14. When a workload sends a request to another workload using mutual TLS authentication, the request is handled as follows:</p><ol><li>Istio re-routes the outbound traffic from a client to the client\\\\u2019s local sidecar Envoy.</li><li>The client side Envoy starts a mutual TLS handshake with the server side Envoy. During the handshake, the client side Envoy also does a <a href=\\\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming\\\\\">secure naming</a> check to verify that the service account presented in the server certificate is authorized to run the target service.</li><li>The client side Envoy and the server side Envoy establish a mutual TLS connection, and Istio forwards the traffic from the client side\"}]', call_id='call_PQ8ZM5lQyyVgsIBuKvONgPvt')]\n",

Traffic is then forwarded off to Envoy proxies that operate per-namespace, such that no Envoy proxy is ever multi-tenant.</p><h2>I have a CNI. Why do I need Istio?<a href=\\\"#i-have-a-cni-why-do-i-need-istio\\\"></a></h2><p>Today, some CNI plugins are starting to offer service mesh-like functionality as an add-on that sits on top of their own CNI implementation. For example, they may implement their own encryption schemes for traffic between nodes or pods, workload identity, or support some amount of transport-level policy by redirecting traffic to a L7 proxy. These service mesh addons are non-standard, and as such can only work on top of the CNI that ships them. They also offer varying feature sets. For example, solutions built on top of Wireguard cannot be made FIPS-compliant.</p><p>For this reason, Istio has implemented its zero-trust tunnel (ztunnel) component, which transparently and efficiently provides this functionality using proven, industry-standard encryption protocols. <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/ambient/overview/\\\">Learn more about ztunnel</a>6.</p><p>Istio is designed to be a service mesh that provides a consistent, highly secure, efficient, and standards-compliant service mesh implementation providing a <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization\\\">powerful set of L7 policies</a>, <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#istio-identity\\\">platform-agnostic workload identity</a>, using <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#mutual-tls-authentication\\\">industry-proven mTLS protocols</a> - in any environment, with any CNI, or even across clusters with different CNIs.</p></div>\\n\\n\"}, {\"distance\": 0.61768484, \"content\": \"<div><div class=\\\"article-container\\\">\\n\\nContents\\n\\n<ol><li><a href=\\\"/latest/docs/\\\">Documentation</a>1</li><li><a href=\\\"/latest/docs/overview/\\\">Overview</a>2</li><li>What is Istio?</li></ol><div class=\\\"title-area\\\"><div><h1>What is Istio?</h1><p><span class=\\\"reading-time\\\"><span>\\u00a0</span>2 minute read</span>\\n<span>\\u00a0</span>\\n<span></span></p></div></div>\\n<p>Istio is an open source service mesh that layers transparently onto existing distributed applications.

However, microservices also have particular security needs:</p><ul><li>To defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, they need traffic encryption.</li><li>To provide flexible service access control, they need mutual TLS and fine-grained access policies.</li><li>To determine who did what at what time, they need auditing tools.</li></ul><p>Istio Security provides a comprehensive security solution to solve these issues. This page gives an overview on how you can use Istio security features to secure your services, wherever you run them. In particular, Istio security mitigates both insider and external threats against your data, endpoints, communication, and platform.</p> Security overview<p>The Istio security features provide strong identity, powerful policy, transparent TLS encryption, and authentication, authorization and audit (AAA) tools to protect your services and data. The goals of Istio security are:</p><ul><li>Security by default: no changes needed to application code and infrastructure</li><li>Defense in depth: integrate with existing security systems to provide multiple layers of defense</li><li>Zero-trust network: build security solutions on distrusted networks</li></ul><p>Visit our <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/\\\">mutual TLS Migration docs</a>3 to start using Istio security features with your deployed services. Visit our <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/tasks/security/\\\">Security Tasks</a>4 for detailed instructions to use the security features.</p><h2>High-level architecture<a href=\\\"#high-level-architecture\\\"></a></h2><p>Security in Istio involves multiple components:</p><ul><li><p>A Certificate Authority (CA) for key and certificate management</p></li><li><p>The configuration API server distributes to the proxies:</p></li><li><p>Sidecar and perimeter proxies work as <a href=\\\"https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/policy_enforcement_point\\\">Policy Enforcement Points</a>5 (PEPs) to secure communication between clients and servers.</p></li><li><p>A set of Envoy proxy extensions to manage telemetry and auditing</p></li></ul><p>The control plane handles configuration from the API server and configures the PEPs in the data plane. The PEPs are implemented using Envoy. The following diagram shows the architecture.</p> Security Architecture<p>In the following sections, we introduce the Istio security features in detail.</p><h2>Istio identity<a href=\\\"#istio-identity\\\"></a></h2><p>Identity is a fundamental concept of any security infrastructure. At the beginning of a workload-to-workload communication, the two parties must exchange credentials with their identity information for mutual authentication purposes. On the client side, the server\\u2019s identity is checked against the <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming\\\">secure naming</a> information to see if it is an authorized runner of the workload. On the server side, the server can determine what information the client can access based on the <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#authorization-policies\\\">authorization policies</a>, audit who accessed what at what time, charge clients based on the workloads they used, and reject any clients who failed to pay their bill from accessing the workloads.</p><p>The Istio identity model uses the first-class <code>service identity</code> to determine the identity of a request\\u2019s origin. This model allows for great flexibility and granularity for service identities to represent a human user, an individual workload, or a group of workloads. On platforms without a service identity, Istio can use other identities that can group workload instances, such as service names.</p><p>The following list shows examples of service identities that you can use on different platforms:</p><ul><li>Kubernetes: Kubernetes service account</li><li>GCE: GCP service account</li><li>On-premises (non-Kubernetes): user account, custom service account, service name, Istio service account, or GCP service account. The custom service account refers to the existing service account just like the identities that the customer\\u2019s Identity Directory manages.</li></ul><h2>Identity and certificate management<a href=\\\"#pki\\\"></a></h2><p>Istio securely provisions strong identities to every workload with X.509 certificates. Istio agents, running alongside each Envoy proxy, work together with <code>istiod</code> to automate key and certificate rotation at scale. The following diagram shows the identity provisioning flow.</p> Identity Provisioning Workflow<p>Istio provisions keys and certificates through the following flow:</p><ol><li><code>istiod</code> offers a gRPC service to take <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request\\\">certificate signing requests</a>6 (CSRs).</li><li>When started, the Istio agent creates the private key and CSR, and then sends the CSR with its credentials to <code>istiod</code> for signing.</li><li>The CA in <code>istiod</code> validates the credentials carried in the CSR. Upon successful validation, it signs the CSR to generate the certificate.</li><li>When a workload is started, Envoy requests the certificate and key from the Istio agent in the same container via the <a href=\\\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/security/secret#secret-discovery-service-sds\\\">Envoy secret discovery service (SDS)</a>7 API.</li><li>The Istio agent sends the certificates received from <code>istiod</code> and the private key to Envoy via the Envoy SDS API.</li><li>Istio agent monitors the expiration of the workload certificate. The above process repeats periodically for certificate and key rotation.</li></ol><h2>Authentication<a href=\\\"#authentication\\\"></a></h2><p>Istio provides two types of authentication:</p><ul><li><p>Peer authentication: used for service-to-service authentication to verify the client making the connection. Istio offers <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication\\\">mutual TLS</a>8 as a full stack solution for transport authentication, which can be enabled without requiring service code changes. This solution:</p><ul><li>Provides each service with a strong identity representing its role to enable interoperability across clusters and clouds.</li><li>Secures service-to-service communication.</li><li>Provides a key management system to automate key and certificate generation, distribution, and rotation.</li></ul></li><li><p>Request authentication: Used for end-user authentication to verify the credential attached to the request. Istio enables request-level authentication with JSON Web Token (JWT) validation and a streamlined developer experience using a custom authentication provider or any OpenID Connect providers, for example:</p></li></ul><p>In all cases, Istio stores the authentication policies in the <code>Istio config store</code> via a custom Kubernetes API. <span class=\\\"term\\\">Istiod</span> keeps them up-to-date for each proxy, along with the keys where appropriate. Additionally, Istio supports authentication in permissive mode to help you understand how a policy change can affect your security posture before it is enforced.</p><div class=\\\"popover\\\"><p><i></i><span> Istiod</span></p><div class=\\\"body\\\"><p>The Istiod component is the consolidated control plane binary that encapsulates the functions of Pilot, Galley, Citadel, and the sidecar injector.</p> <p><a href=\\\"/blog/2020/istiod/\\\">Learn more about Istiod</a>.</p> </div><p></p></div><h3>Mutual TLS authentication<a href=\\\"#mutual-tls-authentication\\\"></a></h3><p>Istio tunnels service-to-service communication through the client- and <p>server-side PEPs, which are implemented as <a href=\\\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/\\\">Envoy proxies</a>14. When a workload sends a request to another workload using mutual TLS authentication, the request is handled as follows:</p><ol><li>Istio re-routes the outbound traffic from a client to the client\\u2019s local sidecar Envoy.</li><li>The client side Envoy starts a mutual TLS handshake with the server side Envoy. During the handshake, the client side Envoy also does a <a href=\\\"/latest/docs/concepts/security/#secure-naming\\\">secure naming</a> check to verify that the service account presented in the server certificate is authorized to run the target service.</li><li>The client side Envoy and the server side Envoy establish a mutual TLS connection, and Istio forwards the traffic from the client side\"}]\n",
